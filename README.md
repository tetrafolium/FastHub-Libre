# FastHub-Libre

This is a foss-friendly fork of FastHub

      height="80">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fastaccess.github.libre)
      
## Changes
- Cleaned from blobs
- Notifications work using native JobScheduler without any push messaging involved, although the minimum supported update interval becomes 20 minutes
- It's possible to unlock features, if needed, in a manner which nudges to still try to find a way and support upstream developers. **Once again, please find a way to financially support upstream developers**. If you, just as me, haven't found any other option than to use the in-app purchases in the upstream app, maybe do it from a friend's device!
- Rebranded in some most obvious places to indicate that "FastHub-Libre" is not exactly "FastHub"
- Ready to be built and included in the F-Droid store

## Why fork and change these bits? (As of October 2017)

- **Technical reasons**
  - Upstream developers will never be able to comply with the [F-Droid's inclusion policy](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_Policy/?title=Inclusion_Policy) 
- **Ideological reasons**
  - Upstream developers get offended by the high standards of the F-Droid community, which inevitably result in an _Anti-Feature: Non-Free Network_ badge for any Github client
  - Upstream developers don't adequately account for users of Android devices without GMS
  - Upstream app has some _PRO_-features. Users without GMS have no way to unlock these features, turning the software into unfixable crippleware
  - Upstream developers have shown in the past that they lack a general understanding of the GPL
  - Upstream developers strongly disapprove that in this fork one can access the _PRO_ features without paying
  	- This fork will have to carry on without approval until a better solution will surface
  	- The unlocking page and the way to this page is made respective and nudging to go and support

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I see my <b>Organizations</b> either <i>Private</i> or <i>Public</i> ones?</summary>
  <p>Open up https://github.com/settings/applications and look for FastHub, open it then scroll to Organization access and click on Grant Button,
  alternatively login via <b>Access Token</b> which will ease this setup.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I tried to login via Access Token & OTP but why isn't it working?</summary>
  <p>You can't login via Access Token & OTP all together due to the lifetime of the OTP code, you'll be required to login in every few seconds.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are my Private Repo and Enterprise Wiki not showing up?</summary>
  <p>It's due to FastHub scraping GitHub Wiki page & Private Repos require session token that FastHub doesn't have.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I login with Enterprise account but can't interact with anything other than my Enterprise GitHub.</summary>
  <p>Well, logically, you can't access anything else other than your Enterprise, but FastHub made that possible but can't do much about it, in most cases since your login credential doesn't exists in GitHub server. But in <b>few</b> cases your GitHub account Oauth token will do the trick.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why am I having problems editing Issues/PRs?</summary>
  <p>If you are unable to edit an issue in a public organization, please contact your Organization Admin to grant access to FastHub. Alternatively you can login using an Access Token with the correct permissions granted.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I'm having this issue! / I want this and that!</summary>
  <p>Head to https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/new and create new issue for bugs or feature requests. I really encourage you to search before opening a ticket. Any duplicate request will result in it being closed immediately.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I get PROMO CODE?</summary>
  <p>Please refer to the in-app FAQ for details.</p>
